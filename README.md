# Scrimba Solo Project

My first react project provided by Scrimba:
- https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact/section-1-solo-project-coce646e88eea46f91af43ca4
- https://www.figma.com/file/4ctPLUvIn5b5Ep6YPOZWWd/Digital-Business-Card?node-id=0%3A129

## Things I learned

- I used create-react-app, learned how to set up the appropriate versions of node and npm.
- I stripped the template to use only what was needed
- I learned how to use Figma to properly style the project

### Things I can do to continue this project

- Add functionality to the buttons and links
- Add nicer background
